# The goal is to create a copy of the Spotify Interface.

- Choose an API for music streaming, such as the [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com).
- Set up an account with the API provider and obtain the necessary API keys.
- Create a new web application and install the necessary libraries or SDKs for interacting with the API.
- Use the API documentation to learn how to authenticate with the API and make authorized requests.
- Implement the ability to search for artists, albums, and tracks.
- Display the search results in a visually appealing way, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

```
    The required pages are:
    - Login page
    - Home page
    - Artist page
    - Search page

    Hints:
    > Organize your styles in order to have re-usable classes amongst the different pages
    > Divide the tasks in a super clear way
    > Finish the single page before moving to the next one
    > Commit and merge often, work on separate branches.
```
